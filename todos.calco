We do use Trello, but for some reason having a todos file
fills me up with determination!

1. Refactor everything lmao, especially to properly use styledcomponents.
2. Instead of lots of repetition, replace with arrays and stuff.
    - Navbar Links
    - many others but I can't think of them atm.
3. Create the account page settings.
4. Completely change the way I handle active icons in the editor sidebar lmao. What is that?!
